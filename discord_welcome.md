Welcome, great to see you here!

This server and our group is a continuing work in progress - our collective input determines what the group and the server become so don't be shy, your input is desired üôÇ 

Our current code of conduct (as a starting point) is essentially the Flutter Code of Conduct: https://enspyr.co/aicoc.  A good place to discuss updates to the code of conduct is systems 

We have regular Meetup events, everyone is welcome: https://www.meetup.com/Adventures-In-Dart-Flutter-Firebase.  There is a corresponding google calendar for easier timezone comparison: https://enspyr.co/aical.

We have a Notion page full of ideas for adventures if you're looking for inspiration üëÄ https://enspyrco.web.app/adv

Our github org has many shared projects you can collaborate on or make your own and there is a step-by-step guide if you have a project you'd like to share. https://github.com/adventures-in

I hope you'll get lots of the community and have some exciting and useful adventures in dart, flutter and/or firebase üèïÔ∏è üî• üéÆ

Not sure where to post?  There are some channels for easy access:

I want to post something and it doesn't seem to fit anywhere -> #random

I want to video chat -> briefly describe the purpose in #event then jump into >event

I was recently chatting in a thread and I want to back there -> Active Threads (see image below)

Otherwise there are 4 categories of channels:

**welcome** : Introduce yourself, read this amazing welcome message or wave to a new arrival.

**collaboration** : Plan potential adventures we could go on, request a code review or share the pain of setting up a stubborn tool.

**discussion** : Discussions related to a specific topic, eg. Dart, Flutter, Firebase, etc.

**projects** : Progress updates and discussion for a specific project.  Links to documentation & the project repo can be found in the channel description.

**icebox** : The place where stale projects go to be assimilated, and where off-by-one errors live.

This welcome message will self destruct in... well who knows?  But the source of truth is at https://github.com/adventures-in/adventures_in/blob/main/discord_welcome.md and everyone is welcome to suggest changes üë©‚Äçüîß
